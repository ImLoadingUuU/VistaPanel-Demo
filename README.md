This repository contains a working demo of VistaPanel, a web hosting panel used in MyOwnFreeHost.  
It has been ripped directly from the browser display files, and customized to function as a demo.

Currently, aside from the working index, almost all pages/features are disabled (as "demo mode" restrictions). In the future, more pages may be added, for the demo to be complete.
